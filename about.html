    <p>
        I am a professor in the department of information systems and in the postgraduate program in applied
        computing at the <a href='https://serra.ifes.edu.br/'>Federal Institute of Espírito Santo (IFES)</a>
        located in Serra, Brazil. Since 2020, I am an IFES productivity researcher. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I am generally interested in robotics and artificial intelligence. My current focus is on applications
        of neural networks for medical image analysis. Previously, I worked on perception, localization, and mapping for self-driving cars,
        and reinforcement learning.
    </p>

    <p>
        I received a B.Sc. in Computer Science, a M.Sc. in Informatics, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
        <a href='http://ufes.br/'>Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES)</a> in 2012, 2014, and 2019,
        respectively. During my Ph.D., I spent a year at the <a href='http://idsia.ch/'>Swiss AI Lab IDSIA</a>
        as visiting student under supervision of <a href='http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/'>Juergen
            Schmidhuber</a>.
